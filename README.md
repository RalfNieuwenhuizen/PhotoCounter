# Install PhotoCounter:
- yarn install

# Run PhotoCounter:
- yarn bundle
- open from XCode and run (Choose developer certificate first)
- Possibly you have to go to Settings -> General -> Device Management: Trust Developer App certificate (XCode will prompt you to do this)

- Good idea to run twice in order to let permissions work (looks like something goes wrong on initial startup)
